### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Esty Scheiner

I'm a Junior Cybersecurity Consultant/Analyst, Front End Web Developer, and Graphic Designer Boulder Colorado. I am also doing my BS in Computer Science at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. I am very passionate about security, hacking, automation, startups, and art. When I'm not developing and building things, you can find me on Youtube learning, writing an article, reading, drawing, or daydreaming actionpacked dreams.
